License checker takes the dependencies in your package.json file and gives you a full picture of your dependency tree

See some examples:

- [Express](/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/expressjs/express/master/package.json)
- [Request](/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/request/request/master/package.json)
- [Glob](/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isaacs/node-glob/master/package.json)

## Issues

- Any dependencies which are name-spaced will not be picked up due to issues with NPM registry data
- Netlify functions timeout after 10 seconds
